## Options Trading -Rules (Iron Condor)
### ENTRY
1. Best Time to Enter

    45 Days to Expiration (DTE):
        This balances premium collection and time decay.
        Theta decay accelerates after 21 DTE, benefiting premium sellers.

    High Implied Volatility (IV):
        Higher IV inflates option premiums, allowing you to collect more credit.
        Enter when IV Rank (IVR) is above 30-50 (higher is better).
        Avoid selling in ultra-low IV environments, as there’s limited premium to collect.

2. Ideal VIX Level & % Change

    VIX Above 18-20:
        A higher VIX means richer premiums. The sweet spot is usually 20-25.
        Above 30: Risk increases due to market instability, so be cautious.

    VIX Spike (>10-15% increase in a short time):
        Large VIX spikes often precede a volatility contraction, making it a good entry point.
        Selling an Iron Condor after a sharp VIX increase can be ideal, as IV is likely to mean-revert.

3. Market Conditions for Entry

    Sideways or Range-bound Market: Best for Iron Condors.
    Avoid during Earnings Season: Stocks tend to have unpredictable moves.
    Watch for Upcoming News Events: Fed meetings, CPI reports, and geopolitical events can cause large moves.

Summary (Entry Checklist)

✅ DTE: 45 Days <br>
✅ IV Rank: Above 30-50 <br>
✅ VIX Level: 20-25 (avoid very low VIX) <br>
✅ VIX Spike: >10-15% increase before entry <br>
✅ Market Trend: Neutral to range-bound

### EXIT
1. When Price Moves Toward a Short Strike (Directional Move Against You)

If the underlying price moves toward your short put or short call, consider these adjustments:
A. Rolling the Unchallenged Side Inward (Defensive Adjustment)

    If price moves toward the call side, roll down the put spread closer to the current price to collect more credit.
    If price moves toward the put side, roll up the call spread for additional credit.
    This reduces max loss but increases risk if the price reverses.

B. Rolling Out for More Time (Extending Duration)

    If the underlying nears your short strike early in the trade, consider rolling the entire position to the next expiration cycle (e.g., from 30 DTE to 45+ DTE).
    This gives the trade more time to work and allows for more theta decay.

C. Convert to an Iron Butterfly (More Aggressive Defense)

    If price is sitting close to a short strike, you can roll the opposite short strike closer to create a tighter, higher-credit Iron Butterfly.
    This makes the position more directional but increases potential profit if price stabilizes near the short strike.

2. When IV Expands (Hurts Credit Spreads)

If implied volatility increases significantly, your Iron Condor will show a paper loss even if price remains range-bound. You can:
A. Wait It Out

    If IV expansion is temporary (like after a big news event), it may contract, improving your position without adjustments.

B. Close and Reopen at Higher Premiums

    If IV continues rising, you can close the position and re-enter at a wider spread and higher credit to improve overall risk/reward.


3. When to Cut Losses? (Stop-Loss Plan)

Having a predefined exit strategy is crucial:<br>
✔ 50% of Max Loss: Close the trade if losses reach 50% of the max possible loss.<br>
✔ 21 DTE Rule: If near 21 DTE and the trade isn’t profitable, consider rolling or closing.<br>
✔ Break-Even Test: If price breaches your break-even level and conditions don’t favor a reversal, consider adjusting or exiting.
