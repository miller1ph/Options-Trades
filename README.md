# Options Trading - Rules (Iron Condor)

## ENTRY

### âœ… Best Time to Enter  

**45 Days to Expiration (DTE)**  
- Maximizes premium collection and benefits from accelerated theta decay.  
- Theta decay speeds up after 21 DTE, favoring premium sellers.  

**High Implied Volatility (IV)**  
- IV Rank (IVR) above 30-50 provides higher premiums (higher is better).  
- Avoid low IV environmentsâ€”low premiums mean lower profits.  

### âœ… Ideal VIX Level & % Change  

**VIX Above 18-20**  
- A higher VIX means richer premiums. The sweet spot is 20-25.  
- Above 30: Increased risk due to market instabilityâ€”be cautious.  

**VIX Spike (>10-15% increase in a short time)**  
- Large VIX spikes often precede volatility contraction, making it a good entry point.  
- Selling an Iron Condor after a sharp VIX increase can be ideal, as IV is likely to mean-revert.  

### âœ… Market Conditions for Entry  

- **Sideways or Range-bound Market** â€“ Best for Iron Condors.  
- **Avoid Earnings Season** â€“ Stocks tend to have unpredictable moves.  
- **Watch for Upcoming News Events** â€“ Fed meetings, CPI reports, and geopolitical events can cause large moves.  

### Summary (Entry Checklist)  

âœ… **DTE:** 45 Days <br>  
âœ… **IV Rank:** Above 30-50 <br>  
âœ… **VIX Level:** 20-25 (avoid very low VIX) <br>  
âœ… **VIX Spike:** >10-15% increase before entry <br>  
âœ… **Market Trend:** Neutral to range-bound  

<br>

## EXIT

### ðŸ“‰ When Price Moves Toward a Short Strike (Directional Move Against You)  

If the underlying price moves toward your short put or short call, consider these adjustments:  

**A. Rolling the Unchallenged Side Inward (Defensive Adjustment)**  
- If price moves toward the call side, roll down the put spread to collect more credit.  
- If price moves toward the put side, roll up the call spread for additional credit.  

**B. Rolling Out for More Time (Extending Duration)**  
- If the underlying nears your short strike early, consider rolling to the next expiration cycle (e.g., from 30 DTE to 45+ DTE).  
- This gives the trade more time and allows for additional theta decay.  

**C. Convert to an Iron Butterfly (More Aggressive Defense)**  
- If price is near a short strike, roll the opposite short strike closer to create a higher-credit Iron Butterfly.  
- Increases directional risk but offers a higher potential profit if price stabilizes.  

### ðŸ“‰ When IV Expands (Hurts Credit Spreads)  

If implied volatility increases significantly, your Iron Condor may show a paper loss. You can:  

**A. Wait It Out**  
- If IV expansion is temporary (like after a news event), it may contract, improving your position.  

**B. Close and Reopen at Higher Premiums**  
- If IV keeps rising, you can close the position and re-enter at a wider spread and higher credit to improve risk/reward.  

### ðŸ“‰ When to Cut Losses? (Stop-Loss Plan)  

âœ” **50% of Max Loss:** Close the trade if losses reach 50% of the max possible loss. <br>  
âœ” **21 DTE Rule:** If near 21 DTE and the trade isnâ€™t profitable, consider rolling or closing. <br>  
âœ” **Break-Even Test:** If price breaches your break-even level and conditions donâ€™t favor a reversal, consider adjusting or exiting. <br>
